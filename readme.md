# Hello!

This is a widget that shows the current progress of the profile creation of the user.\
The user is able to see the missing tasks of a specific area and is able to mark them as done.\
In the development i used _React_, _Typescript_, _Styled Components_ (actually i don't really like it but in this case I decided that it was the optimal decision) and modern _CSS_.\
It was a really interesting experience.\
You can explore the live version of app here: [https://lodgify-code-test.vercel.app/](https://lodgify-code-test.vercel.app/)\
Or you can deploy your local version.
Just clone the main branch and run:\

## npm run i -> npm run dev

for start a dev version
